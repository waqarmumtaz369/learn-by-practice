import tkinter as tk
# import tkinter.ttk as ttk #for themed tkinter widgets

# Window is the main container to hold the other UI elements called widgets in tkinter
window = tk.Tk()

'''
Each widget in Tkinter is defined by a class. Here are some of the widgets:

Class |	Description
----- | -----------
Label |	A widget used to display text on the screen
Button|	A button that can contain text and can perform an action when clicked
Entry |	A text entry widget that allows only a single line of text
Text  |	A text entry widget that allows multiline text entry
Frame |	A rectangular region used to group related widgets or provide padding between widgets
'''
# Add a label widget to display some text on UI
greeting = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter")

# Add a label with modified UI
'''
Different color names like red,orange, yellow, green, purple are also supported an dthe hex codes are also supported like HTML

'''
label = tk.Label(
    text="Hello, Tkinter",
    foreground="white",  # Set the text color to white
    background="#34A2FE"  # Set the background color to black
)

# Shorter form 
#label = tk.Label(text="Hello, Tkinter", fg="white", bg="black")

label2 = tk.Label(
    text="Hello, Tkinter",
    fg="white",
    bg="black",
    width=10, #measured in text units
    height=10 #measured in text units
)

# Buttons are just like labels but are clickable 
button = tk.Button(
    text="Click me!",
    width=25,
    height=5,
    bg="blue",
    fg="yellow",
)

# Entry widget is for onle liner or short text inputs like name and email
# Other properties are similar to teh label and button
entry = tk.Entry(fg="yellow", bg="blue", width=50)

# sample usage of entry with a label
name_label = tk.Label(text="Name")
name_entry = tk.Entry()


'''
Some of the below modifications should work when triggerd like on a buton click. 
It should be covered later in the learning process
'''
# get() function helps us getting the value of entry text entered by the user for further processing 
name = entry.get()

# delete() function is used to delete a character ir a range  of charcaters from the Entry
entry.delete(0)
entry.delete(0, 4) #index 4 is not included and orks just like string slicing
entry.delete(0, tk.END) #tk.END will delete the text till the end 

# Similarly, we can also insert the text in Entry widget at the index position
entry.insert(0, "Python")

'''
Text is similar to the Entry having all supported functions but with a larger text
However, usage of get, delete, insert is little different. 
You have to assume a text box as a table (row, col) of characters for better understanding the modification functions.
'''
text_label = tk.Label(text="This is a Text Box Below!")
text_box = tk.Text()

# Here are some usage of the Text widget modifictions
'''
#===============================GET===================================
text_box.get()                          #will return error
text_box.get("1.0")                     #return one character at row 1 and col 0
text_box.get("1.0", "1.5")              #return a text starting from first character of first row till 5th character of first row
text_box.get("1.0", tk.END)             #return all the text from the text box
#===============================DELETE================================
text_box.delete("1.0", tk.END)          #delete works exactly like get
#===============================INSERT================================
text_box.insert("1.0", "Hello")         #insert also works similar way
                                        #   This inserts the word Hello at the beginning of the text box, 
                                        #   using the same "<line>.<column>" format used by .get() to specify the insertion position
text_box.insert(tk.END, "Put me at the end!")
text_box.insert(tk.END, "\nPut me on a new line!")      #\n is also a character 

.insert() will do one of two things:
#Insert text at the specified position if thereâ€™s already text at or after that position.
#Append text to the specified line if the character number is greater than the index of the last character in the text box.
